# 🚀 Installation

You can install ShieldEye on any Debian-based distribution (Ubuntu, Kali, Mint, etc.) by following these steps:

## Method 1: Using apt (Recommended)

This method automatically installs any missing dependencies (like python3).

- Run the following in your terminal:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ./shieldeye_1.0.0_amd64.deb

## Method 2: Using dpkg

If you prefer the standard Debian package tool:

sudo dpkg -i shieldeye_1.0.0_amd64.deb
sudo apt-get install -f
```

## 🛠 Usage

Once installed, you can launch the app from your application menu or via the terminal:

```bash
shieldeye
```
